# NanoAdjustments
Simple override mod that nerfs the nano suit on DayZ Banov
# What does it change
The override reduces the damage reduction and hitpoints on the top and helmet. I also made it so the nano top goes into the vest slot to keep people from doubling up with the nano armor and an armor vest.
