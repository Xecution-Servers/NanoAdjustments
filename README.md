# NanoAdjustments
Simple override mod that nerfs the nano suit on DayZ Banov
# What does it change
The override reduces the damage reduction and hitpoints on the helmet, top, pants, gloves, and boots. I also made it so the nano top goes into the vest slot to keep people from doubling up with the nano armor and an armor vest. Anything changed from the default settings has a comment next to it that shows what the default setting was.
